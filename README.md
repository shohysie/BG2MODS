Diablo2 Kit Pack - The Amazon Ver 0.9</a><br>

>----------ATTENTIONS----------

It is a Ranger kit for BG2, BGT and EE series.

Only one Amazon is suggested in your team, as high-level skills (e.g. Valkyrie) of multiple Amazons will be in conflict.

Amazon gains one "Skill Point" each level until 3,000,000 exp, player can get one skill that you like to learn by consuming each "Skill Point".
*If you do press a "Skill Point" at skill table but then close the arisen skills table without making a choice, the "Skill Point" does nothing by get wasted!
Some skills do not appear at low level. Maybe you'd store the "Skill Points" up to high level to purchase powerful skills.

Decoys and Valkyries do not occupy the limited quantity of summoned units, but when there're already five summoned units, they can't be summoned. When the Valkyrie is imprisoned or petrified, a reverse magic is required to free her, or else she can't be summoned again.
While on selection, Valkyrie switches to a Defensive mode by press D, and returns to Normal mode by press N. In the defensive mode, she'll not attack enemies initiatively unless get closed and attacked.
Valkyrie voluntarily takes one step away from the Amazon when they get too close, in order to avoid getting jammed when traveling across different areas.
Skill that increases attack rate, e.g. Jab, Fend and Pierce, begins to take effect only when melee (Jab, Fend) or ranged (Pierce) attacks hit.

Dodge, Avoid, and Evade give a huge glowing white wiffle ball animation, so there's an extra component to turns off the animation. (This component comes from the Ease of Use Mod Pack, which also turns off the animation for Spell Trap spell and Cloak of Mirroring.)

>----------KNOWN BUGS----------

  Do Not choose the high-level skill Pierce if your Amazon's ranged attack rate has already reached 5 times per round, or the Pierce skill will cause a decrease of attack rate to 4.5 per round.
  Amazon's combat skills may meet problems in case that MOD items which have immunity from "Removal: Remove Secondary Type" are equipped. This bug does not exist in EE games.

>----------DETAILED DESCRIPTION----------

Amazon
This powerful woman warrior belongs to nomadic bands who roam the plains near the South Sea. The wandering of these groups often brings them into conflict with other peoples, so the Amazon is accustomed to fighting to defend her own. This lifestyle has made her fiercely independent and able to weather severe hardship and travel. While her skill with the bow rivals that of the Rogues, the Amazon is also adept in the use of spears and other throwing weapons, as well as in hand to hand combat. The Amazon is much sought after as a mercenary, in which type of service she will be loyal as long as her own ends are also served. 

Advantages:
- Has three skill trees: Javelin and Spear Skills, Passive and Magic Skills, Bow and Crossbow Skills.
- Can be grand master on spear, bow and crossbow.
- Get bonus of +1 to dexterity on character creation.

Disadvantages:
- Only be female.
- May not wear full plate or plate mail armors.
- May not learn Divine Spells and high-level skills of original Rangers.
- May not Charm Animal and be Stealthy.
- Only can be proficient on all weapons except spear, bow and crossbow.
- Unable to dual class.


Javelin and Spear Skills

Jab
Hunting in the dense rain forests of the Amazon Islands is fraught with many obstacles. Confining overgrowth and fierce indigenous animals conspire to make combat difficult, if not impossible. Early in training, Amazon spear-women must learn to overcome these conditions. By honing their hunting techniques to the point where they are able to deliver many powerful spear thrusts in rapid succession, they learn to finish off one opponent before turning to slay another. The Jab is the most basic of the skills designed to accomplish this tactic. 
This skill provides multiple attacks within the time span of a normal attack. 3 attacks per round in 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV1.
  LV1: +1 bonus to melee attack, -2 to damage; LV5: +2 bonus to melee attack; LV10: +3 bonus to melee attack, +2 to damage; LV15: +4 bonus to melee attack, +4 to damage.

Power Strike
Zerae is the bride of Hefaetrus, and her dominion is vengeance and storms. If an Amazon warrior is on a mission to right a great wrong and has proven herself worthy, the goddess will empower her with the ability to add the electrical power of the mighty hurricanes of the Southern Seas to her stabbing spear attacks. 
This skill adds lightning damage to melee attacks. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the lightning damage to half. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: +2 bonus to melee attack, +1d8 lightning damage; LV10: +3 bonus to melee attack, +1d12 lightning damage; LV10: +4 bonus to melee attack, +1d16 lightning damage; LV10: +5 bonus to melee attack, +1d20 lightning damage.

Poison Javelin
Amazon healers have long since ascertained the potent toxicity of their native flora. Any Amazon warrior devoted to this study is able to recognize particularly lethal strains of plant life, even while traveling in foreign lands. This knowledge allows her to create weapons from particularly virulent woods. 
This skill launches a javelin that causes poison to enemies on the whole traverse route, targets must save vs. death or be poisoned for 1 damage per second. A next skill can be casted immediately after Poison Javelin lauches. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: 1d8+2 piercing damage, target must save vs. death with -1 penalty or suffer poison for 2 rounds; LV10: 1d8+4 piercing damage, target must save vs. death with -2 penalty or suffer poison for 3 rounds; LV15: 1d8+6 piercing damage, target must save vs. death with -3 penalty or suffer poison for 4 rounds; LV20: 1d8+8 piercing damage, target must save vs. death with -4 penalty or suffer poison for 5 rounds.

Impale
Although deftness and superior hand-eye coordination are the hallmarks of the Amazon warrior, they are also well known for the ferocity of their attacks. An experienced warrior is able to focus her fury and deliver blows so powerful that they have been known to shatter their weapon in the process. 
This skill causes powerful but slow attacks with melee weapon, Amazon losts about 30% of attacks of each round. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: +4 bonus to melee attack, +6 to damage; LV15: +6 bonus to melee attack, +8 to damage; LV20: +8 bonus to melee attack, +10 to damage; LV25: +10 bonus to melee attack, +12 to damage.

Lightning Bolt
If an Amazon warrior has proven herself worthy, the goddess Zerae can empower her with the ability to strike down enemies by hurling javelins charged with power as if she had snatched lighting from the heavens. 
This skill launches a trail of lightning and does lightning damage to enemies on the whole traverse route. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the lightning damage to half. A next skill can be casted immediately after Lightning Bolt lauches. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: 1d8+2 piercing damage, plus 4d8 lightning damage; LV15: 1d8+4 piercing damage, plus 4d10 lightning damage; LV20: 1d8+6 piercing damage, plus 4d12 lightning damage; LV25: 1d8+8 piercing damage, plus 4d14 lightning damage.

Charged Strike
An Amazon devoted to the path of Zerae will be able to harness the forces of vengeance and storms. During Rites of Vengeance, Zerae will confer to the Amazon attacks that unleash a wild burst of electrical energy, striking down nearby enemies. A grizzled veteran of the Time of Troubles once said: Spear-women walking the 'Path of Zerae' are best given wide berth, for they can be as violent and indiscriminant as the storms on the Twin Seas. 
This skill enhances your melee weapons with lightning attacks that releases charged bolts. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the chance of hit by more bolts. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: A nearby enemy may be hit by 4 charged bolts, each bolt does 1d3 lightning damage; LV15: A nearby enemy may be hit by 5 charged bolts, each bolt does 1d4 lightning damage; LV20: A nearby enemy may be hit by 6 charged bolts, each bolt does 1d5 lightning damage; LV25: A nearby enemy may be hit by 7 charged bolts, each bolt does 1d6 lightning damage.

Plague Javelin
Practiced and cunning warriors are able to incorporate poisonous vegetation into the organs of wildlife, creating highly infectious and deadly bladders that the Amazons affix to their javelins. These javelins strike a target and explode into noxious and putrescent clouds. Entire armies of creatures and of men have been slaughtered by the ingenious use of these biological agents. The choking cloud created by a plague javelin will incapacitate even the strongest foes. 
This skill launches a javelin that causes a cloud of expanding poison of 15' radius and 4 rounds' duration. Enemies in cloud may save vs. death to reduce posion damage by half. A next skill can be casted immediately after Plague Javelin lauches. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: 2d8+2 piercing damage, poison damage 5d8 per round, enemies must save with -1 penalty; LV20: 2d8+4 piercing damage, poison damage 6d8 per round, enemies must save with -2 penalty; LV25: 2d8+6 piercing damage, poison damage 7d8 per round, enemies must save with -3 penalty; LV30: 2d8+8 piercing damage, poison damage 8d8 per round, enemies must save with -4 penalty.

Fend
Once an Amazon warrior has attained mastery over the spear, she can engage and destroy multiple enemies in close quarter battle. Many of those enemies will be lucky to be alive after the vicious onslaughts of these attacks have ended. Grand Mistress Celestia was able to demonstrate this ability to the Initiates of Athulua by striking down a dozen experienced warriors in the space of an arrow's flight. 
With this skill an Amazon can rapidly strike close targets, her number of attacks per round is set to 10 for 1 round. High-level skill.
  LV1: +1 bonus to melee attack and damage; LV25: +2 bonus to melee attack and damage; LV30: +3 bonus to melee attack and damage; LV35: +4 bonus to melee attack and damage; LV40: +5 bonus to melee attack and damage.

Lightning Strike
Through focus and intense devotion to Zerae, an experienced warrior can harness Zerae's gift of lighting to great effect. Such a warrior is able to call upon the Goddess' might to destroy her enemies, unleashing a bolt of lighting that arcs from foe to foe. 
This skill releases chain lightning from target on melee attacks. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the lightning damage to half. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: chain lightning with 2d8 damage per hit; LV20: chain lightning with 2d12 damage per hit; LV25: chain lightning with 2d16 damage per hit; LV30: chain lightning with 2d20 damage per hit.

Lightning Fury
Possibly the most devastating, and certainly the most spectacular, of all the techniques learned by an Amazon warrior is Lightning Fury. The High Priestess of Zerae will teach select Amazons the secret of focusing the power of the goddess, consecrating a javelin to become the ultimate weapon of vengeance. The energy contained within the javelin is so powerful that its electrical energy explodes from its stricken target, releasing bolts of lightning that strike down hapless foes nearby. Swift and powerful is the justice administered by an eminent Amazon. 
This skill creates a powerful lightning bolt that releases multiple lightning bolts from target. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the lightning damage to half. A next skill can be casted immediately after Lightning Fury lauches. High-level skill.
  LV1: 2d8+2 piercing damage to target, and 2d12 lightning damage per bolt; LV25: 2d8+4 piercing damage to target, and 2d14 lightning damage per bolt; LV30: 2d8+6 piercing damage to target, and 2d16 lightning damage per bolt; LV35: 2d8+8 piercing damage to target, and 2d18 lightning damage per bolt; LV40: 2d8+10 piercing damage to target, and 2d20 lightning damage per bolt.


Passive and Magic Skills

Inner Sight
The lush canopy of trees covering the Amazon homeland allows little sunlight to reach the ground. To better adapt to their environment, the Amazons have developed a technique whereby they can attune themselves to the life forces in the surrounding area and transfer these energies into a source of luminescence. This enables the Amazon and her companions to see her enemies in shadow and darkness. 
This skill illuminates monsters and decreases their ability to defend themselves. This skill has a larger effective area than insight. Can be learned in LV1.
  LV1: -1 to enemy AC for 4 rounds; LV5: -2 to enemy AC for 6 rounds; LV10: -3 to enemy AC for 8 rounds; LV15: -4 to enemy AC for 10 rounds.

Critical Strike
Among the arsenal of techniques employed by the Amazon warrior is her ability to study opponents carefully and detect any weaknesses. She can then use these deficiencies in her adversary to strike at precisely those areas that will cause the greatest injuries. 
This skill permanently grants a chance to do double physical damage with your attacks. Passive skill, learned at LV1, LV5, LV10 and LV15.
  LV1: Set critical strike chance to 10%; LV5: Set critical strike chance to 15%; LV10: Set critical strike chance to 20%; LV15: Set critical strike chance to 25%.

Dodge
To anyone familiar with their natural agility, it should came as no surprise that the training regimen of an Amazon warrior includes exercises specifically designed to avoid potentially devastating blows in combat. 
This skill grants a chance to move out of the way of a melee attack. Permanently +2 bonus to AC against melee weapons and +8% chance to stay out of all physical attacks. Passive skill, learned at LV5, LV10, LV15 and LV20.

Slow Missiles
Through strict martial discipline and focus, an Amazon warrior can attune herself to her environment and the dangers around her, allowing her to react to these hazards with superhuman agility. One aspect of this ability is her knack for avoiding missile fire. Just as the Amazon must master the bow and javelin, she must also learn to defend herself from these same weapons. When an Amazon uses this ability, incoming projectiles appear to move slower than normal, enabling her to avoid them. 
This skill slows down all speed of ranged attack and spell casting of enemies insight. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV5.

Avoid
This ability hones the natural defensive ability of an Amazon. If she stands still, she can predict incoming missile attacks and elude them before they reach her. Most Amazon people can do this if all of their thoughts to the task, but only a warrior trained in this skill can do this even whilst caught unaware. 
This skill grants a chance to move out of the way of a missile attack. Permanently +2 bonus to AC against melee weapons and +9% chance to stay out of all spells of offensive damage. Passive skill, learned at LV10, LV15, LV20 and LV25.

Penetrate
The warriors of the Amazon Islands are legendary for their ability to strike their mark. Warriors with this skill are more likely to hit targets. 
This skill provides additional chance to hit. Permanently +2 bonus to all attacks of Amamzon. Passive skill, learned at LV15, LV20, LV25 and LV30.

Decoy
Amazons derive another benefit while learning to fight in the rainforests of their homeland. They learn, through misdirection and deception, to fool attacking forces into thinking there is another Amazon nearby. This subterfuge causes enemies to waste time and energy hunting down false prey while the Amazon moves in for the kill. 
This skill creates a duplicate image to distract enemies until destroyed or time exhausts. The decoy's health point increases with level of the summoner, and gains bonuses equal to the summoner in Dodge, Avoid, and Evade. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: a 15HD decoy for 4 rounds; LV20: a 20HD decoy for 6 rounds; LV25: a 25HD decoy for 8 rounds; LV30: a 30HD decoy for 10 rounds.

Evade
A warrior skilled in Dodge and Avoid may eventually learn this additional ability. Once an Amazon has sharpened her defensive concentration to this level, she will eventually be able to moves out of the way of harmful area attacks or avoid the wrath of an enraged wizard! 
This skill keeps the Amazon away from the effects of harmful magics. Passive skill, high-level skill.
  Permanently grants 10% chance at each learning to stay out of all spells of magic attack, battle ground and disabling.

Valkyrie
When a warrior has proven her devotion to Athulua through her brave deeds and exceptional skill in battle, the Goddess shows her favor by granting a spiritual emissary to aid the Amazon. These emissaries of Athulua are called Valkyrie, and they are the spirits of the greatest heroes from the Amazon people. The power to summon a Valkyrie is the greatest honor that an Amazon warrior can receive. It is believed this gift is a sign that your place beside the Goddess is assured when you pass from this world-perhaps even as a Valkyrie. 
This skill summons a powerful Valkyrie warrior to fight by your side. High-level skill.
  Valkyrie is a fighter who has the same (or slightly less) level as her summoner. Her ability and equipments improve with her level (+3 equipments at level 20 and up to +5 at level 40), she also gains bonuses in Critical Strike, Dodge, Avoid, and Evade at an equal degree with the summoner. The Valkyrie can follow the summoner across different areas and attack any enemy. She will remain under the caster's control until destroyed in combat or when party rests. The Valkyrie doesn't occupy the limited quantity of summoned units.
  While on selection, Valkyrie switches to a Defensive mode by press D, and returns to Normal mode by press N. In the defensive mode, she'll not attack enemies initiatively unless get closed and attacked.
  Talk with the Valkyrie and you can send her back.

Pierce
After long hours of training, an Amazon warrior's bow arm can develop tremendous amounts of strength. With this strength, and some additional training, the Amazon is able to maximize the power of her bow, enabling her to penetrate multiple targets with a single arrow. 
This skill permanently grants one more chance to attack per round when attack with ranged weapons. Passive skill, high-level skill.


Bow and Crossbow Skills

Magic Arrow
Far in the ancient past, Amazons found their glorious arboreal city of Tran Athulua under siege by the pirates of the Twin Seas. These cut-throats were determined to turn the Amazon Islands into their base of operations. The conflict lasted many months as the pirates laid in for a long siege. During the battle, supplies ran short, and the Amazon archers found themselves without ammunition. Realizing that their defense rested solely upon the ability of the archers to keep the corsairs at bay, the priests of the city prayed to Athulua to aid them. In answer, Athula infused the minds of the Amazons with the power to harness their natural spiritual energies. One by one the archers melded their determination and will into shards of physical force that they then unleashed from their bows by the thousands, firmly routing the corsairs back to sea. 
This skill enchants arrows with magic, converts some physical damage to a more powerful magic damage. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV1.
  LV1: +1 bonus to ranged attack, -1 to physical damage but +2 to magic damage; LV5: +2 bonus to ranged attack, -2 to physical damage but +4 to magic damage; LV10: +3 bonus to ranged attack, -3 to physical damage but +6 to magic damage; LV15: +4 bonus to ranged attack, -4 to physical damage but +8 to magic damage.

Fire Arrow
Hefaetrus is the Amazonian god of fire and rebirth who lives deep within the great volcano, Mount Arnazeus, on the island of Philios. Although primarily the patron deity of farmers, from time to time he bestows his favors upon the warriors of the Islands, so they may keep safe his congregation. Through proper prayer and the sacrifice of many fierce enemies, an especially brave Amazon can attain the power to imbue her shots with the destructive power of fire, allowing her to rake blazing missiles from her bow. 
This skill enchants arrows with fire, converts some physical damage to a more powerful fire damage. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV1.
  LV1: +1 bonus to ranged attack, -1 to physical damage but +1d4 to fire damage; LV5: +2 bonus to ranged attack, -2 to physical damage but +2d4 to fire damage; LV10: +3 bonus to ranged attack, -3 to physical damage but +3d4 to fire damage; LV15: +4 bonus to ranged attack, -4 to physical damage but +4d4 to fire damage.

Cold Arrow
Although winter never seems to find its way to the ever-balmy Amazon Islands, cold climates are not unheard of. The summit of Mount Karcheus on the island of Philios is covered with snow all year long. Deep within an icy cave secluded amongst its towering peaks, is the Great Hall of Mirrors where mighty Karcheus the Watcher sits upon his throne. Ever vigilant, Karcheus keeps watch over the people of the Amazons. Warriors who have trained within his temple are able to instill their shots with the power of a freezing wind. 
This skill enchants arrows with ice, converts some physical damage to a more powerful cold damage. Target must save vs. death with or be slowed for a short while. Skill duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: +1 bonus to ranged attack, -1 to physical damage but +1d3 to cold damage, target must save with -1 penalty or be slowed for 3 seconds; LV10: +2 bonus to ranged attack, -2 to physical damage but +2d3 to cold damage, target must save with -2 penalty or be slowed for 4 seconds; LV15: +3 bonus to ranged attack, -3 to physical damage but +3d3 to cold damage, target must save with -3 penalty or be slowed for 5 seconds; LV20: +4 bonus to ranged attack, -4 to physical damage but +4d3 to cold damage, target must save with -4 penalty or be slowed for 6 seconds.

Multiple Shot
Legend has it that the fabled Amazon archer, Palashia, bragged in her youth that she could best the combined skills of all her greatest rivals. Taking umbrage, her rivals gathered to challenge her outrageous boast, arranging a contest to decide the question. To preserve her honor, Palashia was to strike the targets of all her rivals before they could land a single arrow. When dawn arose on the day of the contest, Palashia stood ready with her bow. At the signal, her rivals nocked their arrows and loosed a volley towards their targets. Palashia gathered her energies, and let fly with her own, single arrow. To the amazement of onlookers, her arrow split into many, cleaving the arrows of her rivals, and moving on to strike every target directly in their centers. This mysterious technique quickly became a martial secret that only the finest archers are able to master. 
This skill launches arrows that splited into several to attack enemies in a cone-shaped area of 120 degrees in angle. May hit enemies that out of sight range. A next skill can be casted immediately after Multiple Shot lauches. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: 1d6+2 damage per arrow, 100% chance to shoot one arrow at each of the enemies in effctive area，and a 50% chance to shoot one more arrow at each of the enemies; LV10: 1d6+3 damage per arrow, 100% chance to shoot two arrows at each of the enemies in effctive area; LV15: 1d6+4 damage per arrow, 100% chance to shoot two arrows at each of the enemies in effctive area，and a 50% chance to shoot one more arrow at each of the enemies; LV20: 1d6+5 damage per arrow, shoot three arrows at all enemies in effctive area.

Exploding Arrow
Another gift of Hefaetrus, an Amazon warrior practiced in this skill can imbue the arrows that she fires with the ability to explode upon impact. The resulting detonation not only allows her to damage her intended target, but also anything caught within the explosive blast. The sight of a full battalion of Amazon archers firing a volley of such arrows is eerily beautiful. Many warriors, having witnessed good friends consumed by the flames of these arrows, vow never to fight against Amazon warriors ever again. 
This skill adds fire damage to normal arrows and explodes on impact. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the fire damage to half. Skill duration: 3 rounds. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10:  +1 bonus to ranged attack, the explosion grants 3d6 damage; LV15: +2 bonus to ranged attack, the explosion grants 4d6 damage; LV20: +3 bonus to ranged attack, the explosion grants 4d6 damage; LV25: +4 bonus to ranged attack, the explosion grants 6d6 damage.

Ice Arrow
The second of the prizes Karcheus bestows to a true warrior, this skill enables the Amazon to instill her arrows with the glacial force of a fierce blizzard. Enemies struck by this power not only feel the icy sting of the enchanted shaft, but also the force of a chilling arctic wind that, mysteriously, they alone can feel. 
With this skill the Amazon can fire arrows with additional cold damage and can momentarily freeze the target unless it saves vs. breath. Skill duration: 3 rounds. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: +1 bonus to ranged attack, +3d4 cold damage, target must save with -1 penalty or be freezed for 1 second; LV20: +2 bonus to ranged attack, +4d4 cold damage, target must save with -2 penalty or be freezed for 2 seconds; LV25: +3 bonus to ranged attack, +5d4 cold damage, target must save with -3 penalty or be freezed for 3 seconds; LV30: +4 bonus to ranged attack, +6d4 cold damage, target must save with -4 penalty or be freezed for 4 seconds.

Guided Arrow
Hunting and fighting during the night and in the deepest darkness is a necessary skill to any daughter of the Amazon islands. Devoted disciples of Athulua can, with great difficulty and strict discipline, train themselves to fire their arrows at targets blindly, as if the hand of Athulua herself guided the arrows. As might be imagined, this is an art that the Sisters of the Sightless Eye have long envied and yet have never replicated. 
This skill imbues an arrow with the ability to seek its nearest target in 30 ft. The arrow may seek back and attack again when it pierces the target, and totally gives 3-6 hits. A next skill can be casted immediately after Guided Arrow lauches. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: 1d8+6 damage per hit; LV15: 1d8+7 damage per hit; LV20: 1d8+8 damage per hit; LV25: 1d8+9 damage per hit.

Immolation Arrow
Hefaetrus will sometimes bestow this ability to his greatest champions. These fire-instilled arrows burn with such a fierce intensity that the very earth surrounding where they impact ignites into flame. Although the fires last but a few moments, some say the effect is as if the pillars of the mighty kingdom of Hefaetrus were reaching up through the ground to strike down the enemies who linger nearby. 
This skill enchants arrows to explode on impact, which leaves a patch of fire on the ground for 4 seconds. Enemies passing through the flames take additional damage. Successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the fire damage to half. Skill duration: 2 rounds. High-level skill.
  LV1: +2 bonus to ranged attack, immediate fire damage of 4d8, and burning damage of 1d8+2 per second; LV25: +3 bonus to ranged attack, immediate fire damage of 5d8, and burning damage of 1d8+4 per second; LV30: +4 bonus to ranged attack, immediate fire damage of 6d8, and burning damage of 1d8+6 per second; LV35: +5 bonus to ranged attack, immediate fire damage of 7d8, and burning damage of 1d8+8 per second; LV40: +6 bonus to ranged attack, immediate fire damage of 8d8, and burning damage of 1d8+10 per second.

Strafe
Once a warrior has attained this facility, she can fire a volley of arrows with amazing speed and precision, striking one target after another. Veteran mercenaries often tell a tale of a new recruit who was nearly struck down in battle because he was too distracted when first seeing an Amazon use this ability. Do not doubt his word, as he is probably referring to himself. Just smile and buy him another tankard of ale. 
With this skill the Amazon can fire a volley of arrows at multiple targets in 30 ft. Skill duration: 1 round. High-level skill.
  LV1: 1d6+6 damage per arrow; LV25: 1d6+7 damage per arrow; LV30: 1d6+8 damage per arrow; LV35: 1d6+9 damage per arrow; LV40: 1d6+10 damage per arrow.

Freezing Arrow
The greatest of the powers attained by those dedicated to Karcheus is the skill to imbue their arrows with the freezing power of a devastating avalanche. Enemies within the impact of a freezing arrow are frozen in their tracks and feel crushing pain, as if a mass of magical ice had toppled onto them. 
This skill enchants arrows to deliver cold damage that freezes any enemies near the point of impact unless they save vs. breath. Successfully saving vs. breath also reduces the cold damage to half. Skill duration: 2 rounds. High-level skill.
  LV1: +2 bonus to ranged attack, cold damage of 4d6, enemies must save vs. breath with -1 penalty or be freezed for 2 second; LV25: +3 bonus to ranged attack, cold damage of 5d6, enemies must save vs. breath with -2 penalty or be freezed for 3 seconds; LV30: +4 bonus to ranged attack, cold damage of 6d6, enemies must save vs. breath with -3 penalty or be freezed for 4 seconds; LV35: +5 bonus to ranged attack, cold damage of 7d6, enemies must save vs. breath with -4 penalty or be freezed for 5 seconds; LV40: +6 bonus to ranged attack, cold damage of 8d6, enemies must save vs. breath with -5 penalty or be freezed for 6 seconds.

*Spear, Bow and Crossbow Skills with durations can not take effect together with each other. Each of them will directly replace a pre-casted one.

V0.7 Now Valkyrie only follows her summoner across different areas, and no longer overlaps any party member (she will voluntarily take one step away). 
  A little damage decrease of Cold Arrow and Freezing Arrow.
  Decoy is no longer selectable. 
  AOE skills now ignore the protection of Mirror Image spell (EE only).
  More detailed descriptions of skills from original Diablo2. 

V0.6 Supports IWDEE.
  Fixed the game crash when summoning Valkyrie.
  Added some animations from Diablo2.
  A little increase of probability of Dodge and Avoid.
  Increased Lightning Fury, the denser the enemy crowds, the more damage it does.
  Detailed descriptions of skills are shown in EE games now.

V0.5 Fixed some details to fit EE games.
  Fixed the BUG that Penetrate can not be learned.
  A Valkyrie strictly follows the summoner (not other teammates) across different areas.
  Multiple Shot can only shoot once now, while its performance is enhanced. 
  Another skill can be casted immediately after Guided Arrow and Multiple Shot. 
  Passive skills are learned automatically with Visual Effects under feet instead of learned by clicking skill buttons.

V0.4 Amazon can wear chain mail armor, but not full plate or plate mail armors.
  Fixed the problem that a Decoy with Dodge and Avoid level is unable to stay out of physical and magic attacks.
  Removed Valkyrie's magic resistance.
  Faster HP Regeneration of Decoy and Valkyrie.
  Decoy and Valkyrie are immune to Horror, Charm, Confusion, Feeblemindedness and Unconsciousness.
  Decreased the chance that a Valkyrie stuck with other creatures that follow the team across different areas.

  When selected, Valkyrie can enter an inactive mode by press "C", and quit the mode by press "C" again. In the inactive mode, she'll not attack enemies initiatively unless get close and attacked by them.
  There's no more casting time or casting interval for passive spells which allow the Amazon to enter an offensive mode, e.g. Jab and Magic Arrow.

V0.3 Supports EE and original BG2. Unsuperposable Amazon skills in EE is treated as official spells: the later casted spell directly replace the previous one; while in original BG2, a later spell can only be wasted before the expiring of a previous one.
  Fixed the problem of missing chances to learn Dodge and Avoid when starting game directly at TOB.
  Dodge grants 6% chance at each learning to stay out of all physical attacks.
  Avoid grants 8% chance at each learning to stay out of all spells of offensive damage.
  Evade nolonger increases your Magic Resistance, yet grants 10% chance at each learning to stay out of all spells of magic attack, battle ground and disabling.
  Yet the new Avoid and Evade give a huge glowing white wiffle ball animation, so a new component for choosing is added to turns off the animation. (This component comes from the Ease of Use Mod Pack, which also turns off the animation for Spell Trap spell and Cloak of Mirroring.)
  Decoy gains a slightly longer duration (2 rounds).

V0.2 The bug that Immolation Arrow, Strafe and Freezing Arrow can't be learned is fixed.
  Valkyrie's Level, HP and equipments grow faster. On level 40 the Amazon will get a max-level Valkyrie with +5 equipments.
  Immolation Arrow will burn on ground instead of on enemies.
  Damage and max hits of Guided Arrow are increased by 1.

*A Charge-up Skill is an attack that adds a 'charge' for each successive hit within 9 seconds. While each Charge-up attack deals normal damage, the charges continue to accumulate, up to 3 charges for each Charge-up Skill. A Charge-up Skill finishes when the 9 seconds exhaust or a Finishing Move is casted, at this time an Assassination effect icon is shown on the Assassin's portrait, which means the accumulated charges are ready to be triggered by a melee attack (each successful charge will +1 to hit on this attack only). The accumulated charges disappear immediately after being triggered, or disappear after 4 rounds if no successful melee attack is done.
 By casting another Charge-up Skill before a previous one exhausts, Assassins can build up a succession of different Charge-up Skills and generate a potent combination of effects.
 While a Charge-up Skill is active, a Contingency effect icon is shown on the Assassin's portrait. This icon disappears just 1 second before the Charge-up Skill expires, which reminds that the Charge-up Skill will exhaust, and it's time to cast another Charge-up Skill or trigger the accumulated charges at a worthy enemy.
 Extra prompts e.g. pause or display string on head, can be active for the condition that accumulated charges are ready. Press S when Party AI On to switch among those prompts.
 A Finishing Move doesn't just stop Charge-up Skills or make the Assassin able to trigger the accumulated charges, it also adds a powerful effect of its own. Yet its effect disappears immediately while another Charge-up Skill is casted.
 Different Finishing Moves can not take effect together with each other, each of them will directly replace a pre-casted one. Different Charge-up Skills will also replace a pre-casted one, although the accumulated charges are kept.

 Changed the icons of Blade Sentinel and Blade Fury.

*If you do press a 'Skill Point' at skill table but then close the arisen skills table without making a choice, the 'Skill Point' does nothing by get wasted!
Many powerful skills do not appear at low level. Maybe you'd store the 'Skill Points' up to high level to purchase much powerful skills.

There's an extra component 'Allow the Barbarian(D2) to use a Two-handed Sword with one hand' which is adviced to be installed after all MODs that bring new weapons. Reinstall of such component alone also provides support for new 2-handed swords added later, but is not recommended.
Equip the two-handed sword in hand and then click on Mode Switching button at skill table, the sword switches to one-handed mode, its Proficiency Type also changes to Bastard Sword. The switched sword can only be used by a Diablo2 Barbaian.
With a sword that switched to one-handed mode in hand, cast Mode Switching again and the two-handed sword comes back. (In no EE games, in order to avoid game crushing, such switching is ineffective when there's something in offhand.)

>----------KNOWN BUGS----------

Barbarian's combat skills may get problems in case that MOD items which have immunity from 'Removal: Remove Secondary Type' are equipped. 
This bug does not exist in EE games.

If there're several Diablo2 Barbarians in your team, and they're all equiped with switchable swords, Mode Switching skill only works on the first Barbarian. You can give the switched sword to other Barbarians.

>----------DETAILED DESCRIPTION----------

Barbarian
The Barbarian, a member of any of several tribes on the fringes of civilization, rebuffs the influence of those he sees as soft and weak. Ceaseless clan warfare and the constant struggle to survive in the hostile wilderness are evident in the Barbarian's sturdy and powerful frame. Though perhaps lacking the sophistication of his civilized contemporaries, the Barbarian has an acute awareness of his surroundings. Because of his shamanistic belief in the animal powers with whom he identifies, the Barbarian is sometimes associated with stories of lycanthropy. In fact, he believes that he can improve his superb battle tactics by calling upon the totemic animal spirits to infuse him with supernormal strengths and abilities. 

Advantages:
- Has a D12 Hit Die instead of D10.
- Get bonus of +1 to strength and vitality on character creation.
- Can use a Two-handed Sword with one hand through a mode switching skill.
- Three skill trees: Warcries, Combat Masteries and Combat Skills.

Disadvantages:
- Get penalty of -2 to intelligence and charisma on character creation.
- May not learn high-level skills of original fighters.
- Only can be proficient in bow and crossbow.
- Only can be master in weapons except bow and crossbow.
- Unable to dual class.


Warcries

Howl
A Barbarian warrior in battle is a fearsome enough sight. They cover their bodies with strange markings and the fire in their eyes can be seen from across a battlefield. Early in his training a warrior must learn how to tap the primal energies around him and utter a howl in battle-a bellow so fierce that it will send even the battalions of the Burning Hells running in fear.
This skill makes enemies in 30' radius run in fear, requires saving vs. breath. Enemies over Level 20 will not be affected. Can be learned at LV1.
  LV1: save with -1 penalty, 2 rounds; LV5: save with -2 penalty, 4 rounds; LV10: save with -3 penalty, 6 rounds; LV15: save with -4 penalty, 8 rounds.

Find Potion
When a warrior is injured while out in the field, he must find ways to effectively heal wounds. By picking among the glands and entrails of the recently dead, a Barbarian warrior can sometimes scavenge enough ingredients to make a powerful healing elixir. Some Barbarians are skillful and fortunate enough to find ingredients for a potion that restores not only their health but their spirit as well. 
This skill increases chance of finding potions after kill each enemy. Duration: 1 round. Can be learned at LV1.
  LV1: potion of healing/antidote/potion of defense/other potions; LV5: potion of healing/antidote/potion of stone form/potion of heroism/other potions; LV10: potion of extra healing/elixir of health/potion of invulnerability/potion of heroism/other potions; LV15: potion of super healing/elixir of health/potion of invulnerability/potion of power/other potions.
 *Find Potion and Find Item can not take effect at the same time.

Shout
Barbarian warriors are born to command in battle. When a warrior learns this skill he can raise his voice above the din of combat to shout warnings of impending blows to his comrades in arms. This will alert them in time to allow them to guard against the incoming attack. 
This skill gives an AC bonus to friendly creatures in 30' radius. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: +3 AC bonus, duration: 1 turn; LV10: +4 AC bonus, duration: 2 turns; LV15: +5 AC bonus, duration: 3 turns; LV20: +6 AC bonus, duration: 4 turns.

Taunt
Pinpointing an opponent's physical weakness is not the only talent a warrior of the Steppes possesses. He can often ascertain what emotional weakness might allow the barbarian to goad an opponent into a fight. A Barbarian taunting an opponent into a blind rage hopes to capitalize on the mistakes enemies may make while so angered. It is this ability that causes Barbarians to have a poor reputation as drinking partners. 
This skill defiances an emeny, who temporarily forgets his spells and skills, to fight you with melee attack. Requires saving with spells. Enemies over Level 20 will not be affected. Duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: -2 penalty to enemy's THAC0 and damage, requires saving with +1 bounce; LV10: -4 penalty to enemy's THAC0 and damage, requires saving with no bounce or penalty; LV15: -6 penalty to enemy's THAC0 and damage, requires saving with -1 penalty; LV20: -8 penalty to enemy's THAC0 and damage, requires saving with -2 penalty.
 *Do NOT cast this skill on friendly creatures.

Find Item
To most people, searching the bodies of the recently slain is a distasteful chore. Quite happy with procuring whatever items are readily visible and moving on, most people often miss useful items. The Barbarian people have never had the luxury of abundance, and their harsh existence has taught them to scavenge every part of the dead for the items they need to survive. What use do the dead have of gold? 
This skill increases chance of finding items after kill each enemy. Duration: 1 round. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: normal equipments/100 gold/cheap gems; LV15: +1 equipments/200 gold/lower gems; LV20: +2 equipments/400 gold/gems; LV25: +3 equipments/800 gold/costly gems.
 *Find Potion and Find Item can not take effect at the same time.

Battle Cry
Gifted Barbarian warriors can benefit from their connection to their totem animals to exploit the primal fears of their opponents. Once a Barbarian unleashes the Battle Cry, even the legions of the dead will become so distracted that they falter in their quest for victory. This permits the warrior an easy kill. 
This skill lowers enemy's defense and damage in 30' radius. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: -4 bouns to AC and damage, duration: 4 rounds; LV20: -5 bouns to AC and damage, duration: 6 rounds; LV25: -6 bouns to AC and damage, duration: 8 rounds; LV30: -7 bouns to AC and damage, duration: 10 rounds.

Battle Orders
Although skillful in single combat, the Barbarian warrior also has a talent for group tactics. It is this ability that makes him a natural leader in combat. An experienced warrior can use this skill to better array his forces in battle, enhancing their ability to overcome the enemy. 
This skill increases maximum HP of friendly creatures in 30' radius. High-level skill.
  Before LV25: +40% max HP, duration: 2 turns; LV25: +50% max HP, duration: 3 turns; LV30: +60% max HP, duration: 4 turns; LV35: +70% max HP, duration: 5 turns; LV40: +80% max HP, duration: 6 turns.

Grim Ward
This skill allows the Barbarian to fashion a totem out of the carcass of his slain enemies. The resulting talisman serves as a grave warning to all of the minions of the Prime Evils. The mere sight of the Totem causes monsters to flee in terror. With additional training the warrior can increase the potency of the ward. 
This skill summons a fetish that will frighten enemies to 30' radius away, duration: 30 seconds. High-level skill.

War Cry
Summoning the ancient powers known to his people, a Barbarian warrior can call on his spirit animal and lash out at his enemies with a cry that halts them in their tracks-a powerful anguish rising to burn the depths of their being. It is this skill that gives rise to the legends of Barbarians being able to sap the life from a creature with a single word. 
This skill damages and stuns your enemies in 20' Radius, successfully saving vs. breath will reduce the damage and stunned length to half. High-level skill.
  Before LV25: 2D4 damage, stuns for 2 seconds; LV25: 2D6 damage, stuns for 3 seconds; LV30: 2D8 damage, stuns for 4 seconds; LV35: 2D10 damage, stuns for 5 seconds; LV40: 2D12 damage, stuns for 6 seconds.

Battle Command
Using this skill a Barbarian can examine the abilities of his companions and, during battle, determine how best the group should apply their various skills. It is this skill as well as their natural abilities as leaders that are gradually shedding the long held stereotype that the Barbarian people are merely ignorant savages. 
This skill increase all saves, THAC0, AC, damage, casting speed and attack speed by 1 for friendly creatures in  30' Radius. High-level skill.
  Before LV25: 2 turns; LV25: 3 turns; LV30: 4 turns; LV35: 5 turns; LV40: 6 turns.

Combat Masteries

Increased Stamina
The tribes of the northern Barbarians are a nomadic people, roaming the vast open plains of the Northern Steppes. Being raised in this environment has strengthened the Barbarian people. Simply by looking at a member of the northern clans, you can tell that they are more hale and hearty than the average person. Such is their vigor! Through strict conditioning, the Barbarian warriors can train their bodies to endure tremendous physical exertions, and at a moments notice can be ready for battle. 
With this skill, Barbarian will infrequently get tired. He will also be immune to negative effect of spells such as Haste and Restoration. Gets in LV10.

Increased Speed
It is a fatal assumption that the Barbarian warrior is slow and ponderous. His great bulk belies a very agile individual. A lifetime of patrolling the vast plains of his native soil, where it is often necessary to cover great distances in very little time, has empowered the Barbarian warriors with the ability to walk and run at surprising rates of speed. 
This skill Permanently increases Barbarian's walk speeds, +1 bonus on start, then in LV5, LV10, LV15 and LV20.

Iron Skin
The harsh grasslands of their homeland offer the Barbarian people little refuge from the elements. Constant prolonged exposure to the sun, wind, rain and other elements has toughened their skin to the resilience of natural leather. 
This skill permanently gives +2 bonus to AC and 10% resistance to physical damage in LV15, LV20, LV25 and LV30.

Sword Mastery
Although there are many gifts from the Great and Ancient King Bul-Kathos, the greatest of these is the secret of steel. Raw iron is hardened and made resilient, forged into weapons of honor and power. Most mortal swords are patterned after the blade first wielded by Bul-Kathos himself. Balancing offense with defense, it is the perfect weapon for the defense of Mount Arreat in the coming apocalypse. All Barbarian warriors learn the secrets of steel at an early age, yet few truly master the deadly elegance of the sword. Those few who do often disdain all other weapons. 
This skill provides maximum proficiency (5 points) in sword (short sword, long sword, bastard sword and two handed sword) style. High-level skill.

Axe Mastery
Barbarian warriors of the Shadow Wolf Tribe are masters of the axe. Through the axe, they sought to match the swiping claws and the biting teeth of the wolves with which they lived and fought beside. These first axes were but crude stones mounted on wooden hafts, and after learning the secret of steel and swords from Bul-Kathos, the axe soon fell into disfavor. Recently, however, warriors and smiths from the Steppes have perfected the axe as a weapon equal to or greater than the sword. The Wolf Tribe once again teaches the swift and terrible power of the axe to those who wish to learn how to cull the weak from the herd and to protect their pack from the legions of Hell. 
This skill provides maximum proficiency (5 points) in axe style. High-level skill.

Mace Mastery
Barbarians who have quested with the mighty Bear Tribe are masters of the Mace. From simple wooden clubs to the contemporary, armor-defeating flanged mace, warrior masters wield these weapons to devastating effect. As the Bear shaman, Koth, said to those who favor the sword and axe, 'When you are beset by hordes of the walking dead, do not come weeping to me if you have turned away from the wisdom of Bear.' 
This skill provides maximum proficiency (5 points) in mace (mace, war hammer, flail and club) style. High-level skill.

Polearm Mastery
Members of the Crane Tribe value distance, grace and a single overwhelming blow over the close grappling form advocated by the Bear Tribe. Though the two clans were wary of one another for many generations, recently the nomadic peoples have commingled and now share their powerful techniques with all that would learn. Crane warriors evolved their pole arm technique from dealing with mounted raiders and fighting in the shallow river waters found in the steppe. A master of the pole arm avoids physical contact with his opponent until he can land a single killing blow. 
This skill provides maximum proficiency (5 points) in polearm (halberd, spear and staff) style. High-level skill.

Throwing Mastery
Although not as well known for their use of bows and other such ranged weapons, hunters from the Steppes have practiced the use of thrown weapons since earliest times. The open grasslands of their native soil are well suited for taking down game with swift and accurate blows from a hurled blade. It seems a natural evolution and a simple matter for them to have transferred this skill to combat. 
This skill provides maximum proficiency (5 points) in throwing (dart and sling) style. High-level skill.

Blade Mastery
Warriors of the Tiger Tribe like to imitate the way tigers use their claws in battle. They are good at wielding their blades to unleash swift and violent attacks, causing fatal damage to their enemies. 
This skill provides maximum proficiency (5 points) in blade (dagger, scimitar and katana) style. High-level skill.

Natural Resistance
In order to survive the unforgiving lands of the north, the people of the Barbarian tribes have developed hardy resistances to the common elements. Heat and cold alike are something they endure often. Since food is scarce while foraging, they have learned to consume species of plants that would slay normal men. Through additional training, a warrior can further fortify himself against these dangers, allowing him to better survive while traveling to unfamiliar lands and battling unknown foes. 
This skill increases resistances to elemental damage by 15%, and make Barbarian immune to poison. Can be chosen for 4 times. High-level skill.


Combat Skills

Bash
The immense physical strength of the Barbarian people is widely known, so it should come as no surprise that this is one of the first skills that they develop as a warrior. Summoning up their renowned brute strength a Barbarian can deliver a powerful and painful blow that staggers an enemy from its feet, knocking them back. 
This skill provides a powerful smashing blow (melee only) that knocks the target back, requires saving vs. death. Duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV1.
  LV1: +1 to melee damage, +1 to melee THAC0, knock back with -1 save penalty; LV5: +2 to melee damage, +2 to melee THAC0, knock back with -2 save penalty; LV10: +3 to melee damage, +3 to melee THAC0, knock back with -3 save penalty; LV15: +4 to melee damage, +4 to melee THAC0, knock back with -4 save penalty.

Double Swing
A Barbarian warrior learns to fight with a weapon in each hand, for after all, are not two weapons better than one? A young Barbarian learns to use both hands independently of each other, striking simultaneous blows at separate targets. As his talent grows in this skill, he attacks with increasing control and accuracy. 
This skill enhances two weapon fighting in 4 rounds, and will automatically repeat casting itself in battle, until losting target for 4 rounds, or another combat skill, which can no work together with Double Swing, is casted. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: temporarily get 2 points proficiency in two weapon fighting style, +1 to melee THAC0 and +1 extra THAC0 with off hand; LV10: temporarily get 3 points in two weapon fighting style, +2 to melee THAC0 and +1 extra THAC0 with off hand; LV15: temporarily get 3 points in two weapon fighting style, +3 to melee THAC0 and +2 extra THAC0 with off hand; LV20: temporarily get 3 points in two weapon fighting style, +4 to melee THAC0 and +2 extra THAC0 with off hand.

Leap
Because of his great strength, a trained barbarian warrior is able to perform great leaps. These jumps are noteworthy, enabling the Barbarian to spring free of dangerous swarms of enemies, and landing with an impact that sends them reeling. 
This skill makes a leap (teleportation) landing with an impact. Can be learned at LV5.
  LV5: 20' leap distance, 10' radius impact; LV10: 30' leap distance, 20' radius impact; LV15: 40' leap distance, 30' radius impact; LV20: 50' leap distance (equivalent to range of visibility), 40' radius impact.

Double Throw
To a Barbarian, fighting with two weapons is considered a fairly simple feat. Not so simple is mastering the art of throwing two weapons simultaneously and accurately. Many young Barbarians are eager to learn this skill, for they will tell you it is concrete proof that they have risen to greatness as a warrior. In truth, they use this skill in tavern games almost as often as they do in battle, winning wagers from unsuspecting drunkards. 
This skill provides +1 attack per round while using ranged weapons (triggered on hitting). Duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: +2 to range THAC0; LV10: +4 to range THAC0; LV15: +6 to range THAC0; LV20: +8 to range THAC0.

Stun
An experienced Barbarian can learn to strike an opponent in areas that promote the maximum effect. By putting enough strength behind a well-placed blow, he can leave an opponent dazed and unable to strike back or flee. 
This skill makes melee attacks able to stun an enemy, requires saving vs. death. Duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV10.
  LV10: +1 to melee THAC0, stuns for 1 seconds with -1 save penalty; LV10: +2 to melee THAC0, stuns for 2 seconds with -2 save penalty; LV15: +3 to melee THAC0, stuns for 3 seconds with -3 save penalty; LV20: +4 to melee THAC0, stuns for 4 seconds with -4 save penalty.

Leap Attack
A young treasure hunter once sought his fortune in a raid for Barbarian gold on Mount Arreat. Hearing tales of the Barbarian people's expertise in close combat, he hired a phalanx of mercenary spearmen to accompany him, thinking their long spears would force the Barbarian warriors to fight from a distance. He soon learned his mistake as a single Barbarian warrior was enough to slaughter his entire party. Ambushing the raiding party from a patch of scrub grass, the Barbarian leapt over them, slaying one whilst airborne, and skewering two more as he landed. Before the would-be thief could draw a single breath, all of his hired lancers had been dispatched. It was a long walk home. 
This skill makes a leap (teleport) onto a target with an attack on landing. The victim may make a save vs. death in order to take only half damage. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: 6D10 damage; LV20: 8D10 damage; LV25: 10D10 damage; LV30: 12D10 damage.

Concentrate
Sometimes a series of blows is not nearly as effective as a single, concentrated strike. A Barbarian trained in this skill learns how to focus his strength into a single blow that cuts through the guard of an enemy and slices through their armor. This technique also puts the warrior in a superior defensive position. 
This skill ensures an uninterruptible attack, which temporarily improves your defense and gives you immunity to threatening influences such as charm, stun, fear, sleep and confusion. Duration: 4 rounds. Can be learned at LV15.
  LV15: +2 to damage and AC bonus, +3 to hit; LV20: +3 to damage and AC bonus, +4 to hit; LV25: +4 to damage and AC bonus, +5 to hit; LV30: +5 to damage and AC bonus, +6 to hit.

Frenzy
Although a Barbarian is capable of calculated blows and tactical fighting techniques, it is his fierce passion for battle that distinguishes him in battle. While using this skill, a Barbarian drives more and more force into each successive blow as his anger and bloodlust mounts. 
In the 1 round's skill duration, each successful attack brings Improved Haste to the Barbarian, and improves his attack frequency and movement rate (up to 10 attacks per round and +10 to movement rate) as well. While Frenzy expires, the state of increased attack frequency and movement rate remains for 1-2 rounds, which may work with other Combat Skills. High-level skill.
  LV20: +2 to hit, +2 to damage; LV25: +3 to hit, +3 to damage; LV30: +4 to hit, +4 to damage; LV35: +5 to hit, +5 to damage; LV40: +6 to hit, +6 to damage.

Whirlwind
Of the Barbarian people, the Tribe of Thunder was the first to draw upon the primal forces of the weather. Tornadoes would ravage their plains as summer turned to the harvest season. The shaman of the tribe would interpret the tornadoes as an omen of evil during times of peace, and as a harbinger of great victory during wartime. Observing the strength of the whirlwind, these Barbarians learned to emulate the swirling melange of the cyclone in their attacks. As time went on and the tribes intermingled, the ability to attack in the manner of the whirlwind was passed down to all of the Barbarian people. 
This skill makes multiple attacks while spinning through enemies, the victim(s) may make a save vs. death in order to take only half damage. Duration: 6 seconds, attack radius: 10'. High-level skill.
  LV20: 12D4 damage per second; LV25: 12D4+6 damage per second; LV30: 12D4+12 damage per second; LV35: 12D4+18 damage per second; LV40: 12D4+24 damage per second.

Berserk
There is a fine line between passion and rage, something the Barbarian warrior knows well. A Barbarian must learn to tread this line while separating one from the other and drawing strength from both. One of the most powerful combat skills a Barbarian can learn is to cross that line into rage, expending the sum of his energy and slaying everything without regard for consequences. When you have slain all of your enemies, what is left to fear? 
This skill provides a powerful attack that leaves the Barbarian more vulnerable, with a AC penalty of 20. Duration: 1 round, may take effect together with other Combat Skills. High-level skill.
  LV20: +4 to hit, adds 4D8 magic damage; LV25: +5 to hit, adds 5D8 magic damage; LV30: +6 to hit, adds 6D8 magic damage; LV35: +7 to hit, adds 7D8 magic damage; LV40: +8 to hit, adds 8D8 magic damage.

*Bash, Double Swing, Double Throw, Stun, Concentrate and Frenzy can not take effect together with each other. Each of them will directly replace a pre-casted one.

Diablo2 Kit Pack - The Druid Ver 0.5</a><br>

>----------ATTENTIONS----------

It is a Druid kit for BG2, BGT and EE series.
Only one Druid(D2) is suggested in a whole game, as multiple Druids' high-level skills and animals will be in conflict.

While on selection, vines, wolves and grizzly switch to a defensive mode by press D, and return to normal mode by press N. In the defensive mode, they'll not attack enemies initiatively unless get closed and attacked.
Vines, spirits and grizzly do not occupy the limited quantity of summoned units, but when there're already five summoned units, they can't be summoned. If they are imprisoned or petrified, a reverse magic is required to free them, or else they can't be summoned again.
Summoned creatures may lose some ability bonus when game is saved and loaded at the instant that summoning spell is just casted successfully.  

>----------KNOWN BUGS----------

On entering some special areas, e.g. the third level of Watcher's Keep, summoned creatures that can follow the summoner across different areas may be lost behind. Try entering again to bring them along.
Molten Boulder, Twister and Tornado always appear on top-left of the caster, its flying road will be blocked by the caster's body when casted towards down-right. You can manipulate the character to move and leave a road for them. 
As the Infinity Engine has some problem on Level Modifiering, some of the summoned creatures do not have correct levels, which may cause a few incorrect attributes.
Some skills and spells may be conflict with MOD items which have immunity from 'Removal: Remove Secondary Type'. Such problem does not exist in EE games.

>----------DETAILED DESCRIPTION----------

Druid
    The Druids are a race of nomadic warrior-poet-kings. Driven from their homelands long ago by their Barbarian brothers，the Druid tribes live primarily in the northern forests. Using mystic secrets passed down through the generations，they summon the elements of fire and wind to do their bidding，and command the creatures of the forest to aid them in battle. Shifting from their human forms into that of wild beasts，gives them abilities far beyond those of other mortals.

Advantages:
- New druid spells and high-level skills: Elemental Spells, Shape Shifting and Summoning.
- Get bonus of +1 to wisdom on character creation.

Disadvantages:
- May not learn spells and high-level skills of original druids.
- Cannot cast Elemental Spells except the Armageddon while in Werewolf or Werebear form. 
- Unable to dual class.

Area of Effect: 30' cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Half
Wielding this spell, the Druid projects waves of molten earth that spread outward and burn a wide swath of destruction through his foes.

Molten Boulder (Invocation)
Level: 3

By virtue of this talent, a Druid can summon forth a huge, rolling mass of magma, bowling over smaller enemies in its path before bursting into fiery shards. The boulder pushes emenies away on its route and hurts them (1d6 fire and 1d6 crushing damage per 4 levels of experience of the Druid, up to 5d6 + 5d6). The boulder also leave a burning tail which lasts for 3 seconds and causes fire damage (1d6 fire damage per 4 levels of experience of the Druid per second, up to 5d6) on emenies who dare to step foot in. A successful Saving Throw vs. spell reduces the fire damage to half.

Arctic Blast (Invocation)

It affects continuously in a short duration and deals damage for several times, which makes 1d4 points of cold damage per second per 4 levels of experience of the caster (up to 5d4) each time and slow the enemy for 1 second + 1 second per 4 levels of the caster (up to 6 seconds).

## <a name="compat" id="nec"></a>Necromancer

Diablo2 Kit Pack - The Necromancer Ver 0.8</a><br>

>----------ATTENTIONS----------

It is a Cleric kit for BG2, BGT and EE series.
Only one Necromancer(D2) is suggested in a whole game,  as multiple Necromancers' high-level skills and summonings will be in conflict.

While on selection, skeletons, golems and revived creatures switch to a defensive mode by press D, and return to normal mode by press N. In the defensive mode, they'll not attack enemies initiatively unless get closed and attacked.
Manually operating a Skeleton Mage to cast spell on an enemy will give him a mark, and all Skeleton Mages will focus on the enemy within four rounds.
Golems and Bone Walls do not occupy the limited quantity of summoned units, but when there're already five summoned units, they can't be summoned. If one golem is imprisoned or petrified, a reverse magic is required to free it, or else another golem can't be summoned.

Two extra components, the first one extends level limits of Corpse Explosion, Poison Explosion and Revive to LV.32 for players of Legacy of Bhaal mode; the second one makes all revived creatures able to follow the summoner across different areas, but may cause lags and bigger non-EE games save files, which is not recommended when some amount of other MOD has been installed.

>----------KNOWN BUGS----------

On entering some special areas, e.g. the third level of Watcher's Keep, summoned creatures that can follow the summoner across different areas may be lost behind. Try entering again to bring them along.

Some skills and spells may be conflict with MOD items which have immunity from 'Removal: Remove Secondary Type'. Such problem does not exist in EE games.

>----------DETAILED DESCRIPTION----------

Necromancer
From the steamy recesses of the southern swamps comes a figure cloaked in mystery. The Necromancer, as his name implies, is an unseemly form of sorcerer whose spells deal with the raising of the dead and the summoning and control of various creatures for his purposes. Though his goals are often aligned with those of the forces of Light, some do not think that these ends can justify his foul means. Long hours of study in dank mausolea have made his skin pale and corpselike, his figure, skeletal. Most people shun him for his peculiar looks and ways, but none doubt the power of the Necromancer, for it is the stuff of nightmares. 

Advantages:
- New divine spells and high-level skills: Summoning Spells, Poison and Bone Spells, Curses.
- Get bonus of +1 to intelligence and wisdom on character creation.

Disadvantages:
- May not learn divine spells and high-level skills of original clerics.
- May not be good alignments.
- May not turn endead.
- Get penalty of -2 to vitality and charisma on character creation.
- Unable to dual class.

## <a name="compat" id="pal"></a>Paladin

Diablo2 Kit Pack - The Paladin Ver 1.1</a><br>

>----------ATTENTIONS----------

It is a Paladin kit for BG2, BGT and EE series.

Paladin gains various auras at different levels. The auras, which take effect each round, can be switched freely.
Auras against the enemy need to be actually triggered by an enemy in the Paladin's sight. Auras for the whole team take effect on the Paladin himself instantly when activated, but the area effect needs to be triggered by anyone within 50' of the Paladin. Exceptions: Meditation, Redemption and Thorns actually work on battle, they only give visual effects in normal times, because the former two Auras are too powerful, and the last Aura may cause problems on cutscenes, etc.

Paladin gains one 'Skill Point' each level until 3,000,000 exp, player can get one Combat Skill that you like to learn by consuming each 'Skill Point'.
*If you do press a 'Skill Point' at skill table but then close the arisen skills table without making a choice, the 'Skill Point' does nothing by get wasted!
Some skills do not appear at low level. Maybe you'd store the 'Skill Points' up to high level to purchase powerful skills.

Holy Shield gives a huge glowing white wiffle ball animation, so there's an extra component to turns off the animation. (This component comes from the Ease of Use Mod Pack, which also turns off the animation for Spell Trap spell and Cloak of Mirroring.)

>----------KNOWN BUGS----------

Paladin's skills may get problems in case that MOD items which have immunity from 'Removal: Remove Secondary Type' are equipped. 
This bug does not exist in EE games.
If you enter the Character sheet without pausing the game, auras may temporarily work wrong (a BUG of the game itself).

Combat Skills

Sacrifice
At what price glory? By sanctifying his weapon with some of his own blood, a Paladin of Zakarum is able to increase his efficiency in combat by forfeiting a portion of his own physical essence. This sacrifice is a symbol of faith that even the lowliest Paladin must submit before the Light, in order that he may prove himself worthy of victory. 
This skill increases damage at the cost of 8% health on each hit. Required Level: 1
  LV1: +9 damage, +3 bonus to THAC0; LV5: +12 damage, +4 bonus to THAC0; LV10: +15 damage, +5 bonus to THAC0; LV15: +18 damage, +6 bonus to THAC0; LV20: +21 damage, +7 bonus to THAC0.

Smite
The sword of a Paladin represents the might of righteousness and his shield symbolizes the strength of his faith. Both are tools he uses to mete out justice. Just as righteousness can give his spirit the fortitude to overcome the attacks of the unjust, so too can faith be a weapon to strike back at those who work to defeat him. To this end, the Paladin has developed several combat techniques that use the shield not only for defense, but also as an offensive weapon. 
This skill brings shield bash that does damage and stunning, allowing the Paladin to pursue immediately wtih a next skill. Required Level: 1
  LV1: 2D6 damage, stun for 1 second; LV5: 2D8 damage, stun for 1 seconds; LV10: 2D10 damage, stun for 2 seconds; LV15: 2D12 damage, stun for 2 seconds.

Holy Bolt
The Paladin can learn to summon bolts formed of pure, righteous energies. These projectiles are vessels of life, bane to the undead and demons, and succor to the faithful. At the battle of Taelohn Bridge, the villagers feared the day was lost when an army of the walking dead besieged them. Just as the battered militia was about to be overwhelmed, a small band of Paladins appeared. Wading through the rotting carcasses of the living dead and hurling spheres of pure Light that expelled the evil controlling the battling corpses while renewing the strength of the remaining villagers. 
This skill launches bolt of energy that damages hostile Undead and Demons, or heals friendly units with HP as half of damages. Required Level: 5
  LV5: 4D6 damage; LV10: 6D6 damage; LV15: 8D6 damage; LV20: 10D6 damage.

Zeal
A noble Paladin, fervent in his dedication to righteousness, can draw upon the spirit of that dedication to perform seemingly impossible tasks. When surrounded by his enemies, a Paladin versed in this skill sets upon his adversaries with the zealous fervor of many times his number. 
This skill provides quick attacks on adjacent enemies. Required Level: 10
  LV10: Attack twice per round, +1 melee damage, +2 bonus to melee THAC0; LV15: Attack 3 times per round, +2 melee damage, +3 bonus to melee THAC0; LV20: Attack 4 times per round, +3 melee damage, +4 bonus to melee THAC0; LV25: Attack 5 times per round, +4 melee damage, +5 bonus to melee THAC0.

Charge
In showing fear, a Paladin displays his lack of faith, and a faithless Paladin is less than a man - let alone a knight. This is vital in that when all else fails, it is faith that will carry the Paladin through to victory. Warriors of faith never shirk from combat, but rush forward with heads down and shields up, allowing their glory to carry them into the thick of battle to deliver the first blow. 
This ability causes the Paladin to close the distance with an enemy, delivering a bash on contact. The enemy is knocked back, which makes it easy for the Paladin to pursue with another skill immediately. The victim(s) may make a save vs. death in order to take only half damage. Required Level: 10
  LV10: 6D10 damage; LV15: 8D10 damage; LV20: 10D10 damage; LV25: 12D10 damage.

Vengeance
When a Paladin undertakes a crusade to banish evil, he is permitted to call upon the just souls of past crusades. Thus summoned, the spirits of the honorably vanquished manifest themselves and lend their energies to the weapons of the Paladin. 
This skill adds Elemental (Fire, Lightning, Cold and Acid) damage to all melee attacks. Required Level: 15
  LV15: 1D4 each elemental damage, +2 bonus to THAC0; LV20: 1D6 each elemental damage, +3 bonus to THAC0; LV25: 1D8 each elemental damage, +4 bonus to THAC0; LV25: 1D10 each elemental damage, +5 bonus to THAC0.

Blessed Hammer
The Visions of Akarat tell of a hopeless battle. Legions of the undead had laid siege to a small convent of nuns who were the keepers of a sacred relic, the Hammer of Ghrab Thaar. Suspended over a fiery chasm within the convent, the sisters knew the Hammer to be a powerful vessel of the Light and vowed never to allow it to fall into the hands of evil. With no weapons of their own, and no one to defend them, the nuns sacrificed themselves to destroy the hammer. Rather than let the undead despoil the church and the relic, they took the hammer and plunged themselves into the fiery chasm. At that moment, a powerful force of Light washed over the undead legion, striking them down where they stood. Since that time a well-trained Paladin is able to tap the remnants of this released energy, whirling a magical hammer to strike down his adversaries, especially the forces of the walking dead. 
This skill summons a hammer composed of magic power to fly towards the enemy, dealing considerable damage. Demons and undead take 50% extra damage, furthermore, the Undead must save vs. death with a certain penalty or be destroyed. Required Level: 15
  LV15: 6D6 damage, no save penalty; LV20: 6D8 damage, -2 save penalty; LV25: 6D10 damage, -4 save penalty; LV30: 6D12 damage, -6 save penalty.

Conversion
Through force of will and strength of steel, a noble Paladin with this skill is able to blind his enemies with the glory of the Light. After trading blows with the Paladin and facing the fire of righteousness burning in his eyes, an enemy will sometimes be struck with a divine epiphany and momentarily repent his past undertakings. So complete is the transformation, that the converted will turn to slay its former comrades. 
With this skill, a successful attack has a chance to convert the target to fight evil. Convert for 16 Seconds. High-Level skill.
  Before LV25: 30% chance; LV25: 35% chance; LV30: 40% chance; LV35: 45% chance; LV40: 50% chance.

Holy Shield
To a Paladin, the shield is a symbol of his faith. Particularly devout Paladins can channel their faith into their shields, bolstering its defensive value with holy energy. The purer his faith, the greater his defense. 
This skill magically enhances shield to give defense bonuses and block physical attacks as well as spells of offensive damage. A shield must be equipped for activing this skill. High-Level skill.
  Before LV25: +4 bonus to AC, 30% chance to block with a shield, duration 30 seconds; LV25: +5 bonus to AC, 35% chance to block with a shield, duration 60 seconds; LV30: +6 bonus to AC, 40% chance to block with a shield, duration 90 seconds; LV35: +7 bonus to AC, 45% chance to block with a shield, duration 120 seconds; LV40: +8 bonus to AC, 50% chance to block with a shield, duration 150 seconds.

Fist of the Heavens
This spell allows the Paladin to summon the power of holy vengeance. Manifesting as lightning from the heavens, these bolts rain down from the sky, exploding into a thousand shafts of light that radiate outwards to banish the evil from the battlefield. 
This skill calls lightning attack from the sky that releases Holy Bolts (equivalent to Holy Bolts released by a Paladin with a half level of the caster). The victim(s) may make a save vs. death in order to take only half lightning damage. High-Level skill. 
  Before LV25: 8D12 damage; LV25: 10D12 damage; LV30: 12D12 damage; LV35: 14D12 damage; LV40: 16D12 damage.

*Sacrifice, Zeal, Vengeance and Conversion do not take effect at the same time. Each of them will directly replace a pre-casted one.
*After casting of Holy Bolt, Smite and Charge, another skill can be casted immediately.

   Aura effects no longer pile up when several Paladins start the same aura.
   Many skills now have corresponding sounds and animations, and characters are no longer required to glow as a mark for auras.

   Added 10% chance to Conversion.
   Holy Shield no longer presents magic resistance, but generates chance to block physical attacks and spells of offensive damage.

(This component comes from the Ease of Use Mod Pack, which also turns off the animation for Spell Trap spell and Cloak of Mirroring.)

## <a name="compat" id="sor"></a>Sorcerer

Diablo2 Kit Pack - The Sorcerer Ver 0.4</a><br>

>----------ATTENTIONS----------

It is a Sorcerer kit for EE games only, not for original BG series.
The Sorcerer is able to select wizard spells on level up, but immediately forgets them, with only Diablo2 spells left.

Only one Sorcerer(D2) is suggested in a whole game, as multiple Sorcerers' skills and hirelings are in conflict.

When selected, a hireling switches to a Defencive mode by press D, and returns to Normal mode by press N. In the defencive mode, he'll not attack enemies initiatively unless get closed and attacked.
A hireling voluntarily takes one step away from the Sorcerer when they get too close, in order to avoid getting jammed when traveling across different areas. 
You can speak with a hireling and give him some potion to drink.
Hirelings do not occupy the limited quantity of summoned units, but when there're already five summoned units, they can't be summoned. If one hireling is imprisoned or petrified, a reverse magic is required to free him, or other hirelings can't be summoned.

>----------KNOWN BUGS----------

Frozen Orb always appears on top-left of the caster, its flying road will be blocked by the caster's body when casted towards down-right. You can manipulate the character to move and leave a road for it. 

As the Infinity Engine has some problem on Level Modifiering, sometimes hirelings do not have correct levels, yet their attributes can grow up correctly.

>----------DETAILED DESCRIPTION----------

Sorcerer
    The Sorcerer is an expert in mystical creation ex nihilo. Though somewhat lacking in the skills of hand-to-hand combat, he compensates for this weakness with fierce combative magic for both offense and defense. Solitary and reclusive, the Sorcerer acts based on motives and ethics inscrutable to most, and sometimes seems capricious and even spiteful. In reality, he understands the struggle between Order and Chaos all too clearly, as well as his role as a warrior in this battle. 

Advantages:
- New spells and high-level skills: Cold, Lightning and Fire Spells.
- No interval between spells.
- Constantly restoring spells to memory with the skill Warmth. 

Disadvantages:
- May not learn spells and high-level skills of original sorcerer.
