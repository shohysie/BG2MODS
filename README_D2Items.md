## <a name="interact" id="interact"></a>Interaction With Diablo2 Kits MOD

</a><br>
This Item Store can interact with <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/59268-diablo2-kit-pack-series-for-tob-ee-v230326/">Diablo2 Kit Pack Series</a>, and is recommended to be installed after all Diablo2 Kits.
If Diablo2 Kits are installed after this Item Store, there is still a chance (only once) for activing the interaction by installing the component [Attain ability of recognizing Diablo2 Kits for Jamella] of this MOD. Such component is often skipped in other cases.
The interactive content is as follows:
The more teammates choose Diablo2 Kits, the more funds you have for buying equipments in her store.
For Diablo2 Kits, the Sorcerer has chance to choose a powerful weapon for his mercenary, and the the Necromancer can also summon a Iron Golem with weapon, which occupy their bouns for buying.
Note: Multiple teammate with a same kit is not supported in Diablo2 Kits MOD, as well as this MOD.

Some equipments are already on the list, but cannot be bought from Jamella's store. In the next version, encounters or some other forms will be arranged as a method to get such items.
Equipments that have some properties to grow up with the character level, may need to be re-equipped after level up for the enhancemet to take effect.
Some of the spell effects on equipments may not work when the number of summoned creatures reaches the game limit.
Items that are immune to changes in certain element resistance are immune to both increasing and decreasing in such resistance. It is recommended to enhance element resistance with other methods before picking up the item.
